# Leaflet_challenge15

## Overview
This project visualizes earthquake data on a map using the Leaflet library. It is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1:** Displays earthquake data with color-coded markers based on the earthquake depth.
2. **Part 2:** Adds tectonic plates data, different base maps, and layers control for enhanced visualization.

## Files
- **'index.html'**: The main HTML file that includes the necessary Leaflet and D3.js libraries and links to the JavaScript files.
- **'part1.js'**: JavaScript file containing the code for Part 1 of the assignment.
- **'part2.js'**: JavaScript file containing the code for Part 2 of the assignment.
- **'style.css'**: CSS file to style the map and legend.
  
## Instructions
## Part 1
1. **Setup Map:** Initialize a map centered on the United States.
2. **Earthquake Data:** Fetch and display earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed.
3. **Color Coding:** Color-code the markers based on earthquake depth.
4. **Legend:** Add a legend to explain the color coding.

## Part 2
1. **Additional Layers:** Add tectonic plates data.
2. **Base Maps:** Provide multiple base maps, including a satellite view.
3. **Layers Control:** Add control for toggling between different base maps and overlays.

## Running the Project
1. Open **'index.html'** in a web browser.
2. The map will load with earthquake data and relevant features as specified in Parts 1 and 2.

## Screenshots
Screenshots of the outputs for Part 1 and Part 2 have been uploaded to the repository. These screenshots show the map with earthquake markers and pop-ups displaying additional information.

## Deployment
